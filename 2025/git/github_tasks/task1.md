### **Task 1: Fork and Clone the Repository**  

#### **Step 1: Fork the Repository**  
Forking creates a personal copy of a repository on your GitHub account.  

1. Go to the original repository on GitHub.  
2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right corner).  
3. After forking, you will have a copy under your GitHub account.  

#### **Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository**  
Now, clone your forked repository to your local machine.  

1. Copy the repository URL (from your forked repo, not the original).  
2. Run the following command in your terminal:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

3. Change into the project directory:  

```sh
cd repository-name
```

Now, you have a local copy of the repository.
